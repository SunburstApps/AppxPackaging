# Sunburst AppX Packaging

This repository contains MSBuild targets and tasks that automate the process of
creating an AppX package for development purposes. At some point in the future,
it will also be able to create and sign an AppX package for deployment purposes
as well.

(Proper documentation on how to use this code has not yet been written. Sorry about that!)
